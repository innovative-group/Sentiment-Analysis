## Documentation
## introduction:
    1> Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting whether the opinions is positive, negative          
       or neutral.

    2> The sentiment analysis on education system reviews of our project will be achieved using NaÃ¯ve Bayes Algorithm.

    3> Our project allows computers to automatically process opinions just as human does.
